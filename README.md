23.11.2016 was a big day in my life. a big hug to all contributors in the open source projects nodejs, angular, angular cli, v8 and libuv.
for a better world. a free world, for us and future generations. open standards. we will get it done. linus just for fun.


26.11.2016 typescript
after reading many documentations, watched videos and breezed through several books. 
i use this extension of javascript in several projects.

these are my conclusions: delete it. it's going to die. from the originators comes no good.
they are not from the open source world but have compeletely different intentions.
make a buck off of something. steal it and sell it.

there is no chance that typescript will ever replace javascript and they can sabotage in their browsers for the next century,
and impede progress in the standards committee.

their technologies will be ignored by the development communities and eventually they will all fall into oblivion.

that said i will continue to use this .ts extension well aware of the origins and will continue to analyze and take their documentation, books and code apart. uncover all fallacies and manipulations. this represents an attack against my family, beliefs and principles.
i declare war. i will recommend whenever i can to ignore typescript that is how we in my world show our feelings.

another option, there are many options and i am certain that there are many who will also not be fooled.
