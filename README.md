23.11.2016 was a big day in my life. a big hug to all contributors in the open source projects nodejs, angular, angular cli, v8 and libuv.
for a better world. a free world, for us and future generations. open standards. we will get it done. linus just for fun.


26.11.2016 typescript
after reading many documentations, watched videos and breezed through several books. 
i use this extension of javascript in several projects.

these are my conclusions: delete it. it's going to die. from the originators comes no good.
they are not from the open source world but have compeletely different intentions.
make a buck off of something. steal it and sell it.

there is no chance that typescript will ever replace javascript and they can sabotage in their browsers for the next century,
and impede progress in the standards committee.

their technologies will be ignored by the development communities and eventually they will all fall into oblivion.

that said i will continue to use this .ts extension well aware of the origins and will continue to analyze and take their documentation, books and code apart. uncover all fallacies and manipulations. this represents an attack against my family, beliefs and principles.
i declare war. i will recommend whenever i can to ignore typescript that is how we in my world show our feelings.

another option, there are many options and i am certain that there are many who will also not be fooled.

03.12.2016 i have been reading angular 2 books on safaribooksonline, there are many errors and i read where the authors are coming from.
the enthusiasm and love for the framework does not come through, rather the contrary, antipatterns, discrediting and attempts to break it, that is old stuff that i have already witnessed on the pluralsight website. they are really capable of investing a lot of time and effort in trying to choke off new technologies that could endanger them in the future. the same game as with linux. kill the new technologies before they grow. they have not changed. greed and fear go hand in hand. they fear google, that is a good thing. competition is what is needed. it is sure that google will replace them, then there is the question if google will adopt the same behaviors? with great power comes great responsibilities, the superhero ethics. it's all about money in our global system. increase shareholder value is what they teach in mba courses. so the enterprises do that. then there is also fair play. competition yes, competition is awesome, but backstabbing is not heroic behavior. put the knife in the front and look him straight in the eye. samurai spirit, men of honor who take full responsibility for their actions. i respect that. in a perfect world there would only be code, love and innovation ... we're in this together, we have much to do, evolution and revolution. perpetually striving forwards ... harder, faster, better, stronger. so that future generations have more technology, innovation, quality of life. i would like to see the world in 100 years time. what will it be like? will everything be automated? what about the human mind? 100 years fast forward in a time machine would be a dream, today ...
