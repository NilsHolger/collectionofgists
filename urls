Node.js is written in C++. V8 is written in C++. libuv is written in C. It seems that performance of C++ outperforms JavaScript.
JavaScript on the client. JavaScript on the Server. C++ for High Performance Components to power all this or run in the background.
I think that in the future everything will run on JavaScript. A bright future ahead for the couple JavaScript and C++.
Brendan Eich and Bjarne StrousStrop have developed some killer technologies. Linus Torvalds, the Linux Foundation, also plays a big role
in this mix. He is in NodeJS.

"I have an ego the size of a small planet."
"My name is Linus and I am your God."
"Open Source has won." Technological Darwinian Principle. Survival of the fittest technology. yum, yum.
